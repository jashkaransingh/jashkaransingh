# Jashkaran Singh

I'm a student developer at Penn State University studying Computational Data Science with a minor in Computational Mathematics. My focus lies in building practical software solutions, particularly iOS apps and full-stack web tools that are simple, fast, and intuitive. I enjoy bridging backend logic with clean, responsive frontends.
